#E-commerce Shoppers Behaviour Analysis
This repository contains the code and data for my independent project analyzing and predicting e-commerce shopper behavior.

Project Overview
Goal: Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a given user will make a purchase based on their historical e-commerce behavior.
Challenges: Handling imbalanced class distribution (more non-purchasing users) and complex customer behavior patterns.
Approach: Utilize the HistGradientBoostingClassifier algorithm to build a robust and interpretable model.
Key Learnings
Effective feature engineering can significantly improve model performance.
Balancing class distribution with appropriate techniques is crucial for imbalanced datasets.
HistGradientBoostingClassifier proves well-suited for complex nonlinear relationships in shopper behavior data.
Results
Achieved an F1-macro score of 0.64706, demonstrating the model's ability to accurately predict both purchasing and non-purchasing users.
Identified critical factors influencing purchase decisions, such as browsing frequency, past purchase history, and product interest.
